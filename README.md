# Personalized-Movie-Recommendation-System-
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system based on the content of movies. It utilizes text analysis techniques to extract features from movie descriptions and calculates similarities between movies to suggest similar titles to users.


# Problem Statement
Users often struggle to discover new movies that align with their preferences. Current recommendation systems may not effectively capture user interests or provide relevant suggestions.

# Project Description
This project aims to develop a simple content-based movie recommendation system to address the aforementioned problem. By utilizing a pre-computed similarity matrix, the system suggests movies similar to a user's preferred title.

# Functionality:
User Input: Prompts the user to enter their favorite movie title.
Movie Matching: Finds the closest match for the input movie title within a dataset.
Similarity Calculation: Utilizes a pre-computed similarity matrix to identify movies similar to the input.
Recommendation Generation: Presents a list of recommended movies based on similarity scores.

# Limitations
The current implementation of the movie recommender faces several limitations:

Reliance on a pre-computed similarity matrix.
Lack of incorporation of user preferences or ratings.
Basic text matching for movie title comparison.
Limited number of recommendations.
# Potential Improvements
To enhance the movie recommender's capabilities, the following improvements can be considered:

Calculate similarity based on movie features like genre, cast, or plot.
Incorporate user ratings or preferences.
Explore collaborative filtering techniques.
Implement a more robust search mechanism for movie titles.
Expand the number of recommended movies.
By addressing these limitations, the system can evolve into a more robust and personalized movie recommendation solution.
