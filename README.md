# Personalized-Movie-Recommendation-System-
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system based on the content of movies. It utilizes text analysis techniques to extract features from movie descriptions and calculates similarities between movies to suggest similar titles to users.


# Problem Statement
* Users often encounter difficulties in discovering new movies that align with their preferences.
  
* Existing recommendation systems frequently fail to effectively capture user interests or deliver pertinent suggestions. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a system that offers tailored movie recommendations based on content similarity.

# Proposed Solution
* A content-based movie recommendation system will be implemented. This system will employ text analysis techniques to extract features from movie descriptions, such as genre, plot, and cast information.

* These extracted features will be used to calculate similarity scores between movies. Based on these similarity scores, the system will recommend movies that are most similar to the user's preferred movie.

# Methodology
* Data Acquisition: A dataset containing movie titles and descriptions will be collected.

* Data Preprocessing: The collected data will undergo preprocessing steps, including cleaning, normalization, and tokenization.

* Feature Extraction: Text analysis techniques, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), will be applied to extract relevant features from movie descriptions.

* Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity will be used to compute the similarity between movie feature vectors.

* Recommendation Generation: Based on the calculated similarities, a list of recommended movies will be generated for the user.




# Conclusion
This project aims to develop a foundational content-based movie recommendation system. By addressing the limitations and incorporating advanced techniques, this system can be expanded into a robust and personalized recommendation platform.
